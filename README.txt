A first project with aim to introduce myself to the basic concepts of Rust and (later on) the GGEZ game-engine as well as development using git and github. This read-me will be more of a documentation of the project rather than a pure read-me. So here goes, a first branch, commit and PR. WoopWoop!

Now trying to set up the git in vs code and adding this file here and then pushing it. The plan is (of course) to simply commit all changes to github as this project continues. I think i might have everything set up correctly now, that is if this file will show up in github soon :)

Lazy notes for next time:
- to upload a local project to github:
    - git init
    - git add . (when standing in local dir)
    - git remote add twenty48 https://github.com/pluoner/twenty48.git (link from github)
- git add -A (to get all changes to the staging area)
- git status (to see status...)
- git commit
- git push <repo-name>
